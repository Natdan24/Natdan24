### 🚀 *Projects*:

🎵 Musical_Instrument_Recognition using Tradional Methods
1. 🔮 ML_Instrument_Classification
📝 Description: 
This project explores the adaptation of a GMM-SVM hybrid model, originally designed for speaker identification, to classify musical instruments. By leveraging MFCC feature extraction, GMM-based modeling, and SVM classification, we achieve robust results in distinguishing between 10 instrument classes. We further optimize classification accuracy through dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA) and dataset-specific parameter tuning.

📌 Key Features:
✅ MFCC-based feature extraction
✅ GMM probability modeling
✅ SVM classification with log-likelihood inputs
✅ Dataset of 10 instrument classes

🔬 Results:
🎻 Highest accuracy: 91% (LSTM Model)
🎵 Traditional GMM-SVM approach: 83% accuracy

🚀 Future Scope:

Exploring hybrid models (e.g., GMM-SVM + LSTM)

Feature engineering enhancements (e.g., spectral contrast, chroma features)

Expanding datasets for real-world robustness
